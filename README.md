  ## Installation
  To be able to run this application, the user will need to run `npm install` in order to install any dependencies that are in the package.json file. In this case the `inquirer` and `mysql` packages need to be installed. Inquirer prompts the user from the command-line a series of questions and takes user input data. Then to run the application, use `node employeeTracker.js`.

  ## Usage
  Once the user installs all dependencies and runs the application with `node employeeTracker.js`, they will be able to view all employees, departments and roles of the employees as well as add and remove departments, employees and roles.
